> Using NanoGPT with SillyTavern for character-based chat

# SillyTavern Integration

Configure NanoGPT:

* Select "OpenAI" as the API type (NanoGPT uses an OpenAI-compatible API)
* Enter your NanoGPT API key
* Set the API URL to: `https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1` (SillyTavern understands the modern `delta.reasoning` stream)
* Set the Model to: `chatgpt-4o-latest` (or another model of your choice)

**Important Note**: If you choose the Chat Completions endpoint in SillyTavern, you will see NanoGPT automatically appear as an option.
