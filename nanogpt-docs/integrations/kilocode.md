# Using Kilo Code with NanoGPT

A quick guide to setting up Kilo Code with NanoGPT's API.

## Setup Instructions

1. Get your API key from [nano-gpt.com/api](https://nano-gpt.com/api)
2. In Kilo Code settings, add a new Custom Model with these details:
   * API Provider: OpenAI Compatible
   * Base URL: [https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1/](https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1/)
   * API Key: Your key from step 1
   * Model ID: gpt-4o

That's it! You can now use Kilo Code with every model you can think of. Model names are on our [pricing page](https://nano-gpt.com/pricing) - important ones are o1, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, yi-lightning, deepseek/deepseek-chat, or just any other model you fancy.
