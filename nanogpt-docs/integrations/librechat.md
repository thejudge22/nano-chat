# Using LibreChat with NanoGPT

A quick guide to setting up LibreChat with NanoGPT's API.

## Setup Instructions

1. Get your API key from [nano-gpt.com/api](https://nano-gpt.com/api)
2. Locate your LibreChat installation's `librechat.example.yml` file
3. Create a copy named `librechat.yml`
4. Add the following configuration to your `librechat.yml`:

```yaml  theme={null}
# NanoGPT Example
- name: 'NanoGPT'
  apiKey: '${NANO_GPT_API_KEY}'
  baseURL: 'https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1/'
  models:
      default: [
        "chatgpt-4o-latest",
        "gpt-4o-mini",
        ]
      fetch: true
  addParams:
    reasoning_content_compat: true
  titleConvo: true
  titleModel: 'gpt-4o-mini'
  modelDisplayLabel: 'NanoGPT'
  iconUrl: https://nano-gpt.com/logo.png
```

LibreChat currently streams internal thinking from the legacy `reasoning_content` field. The `addParams` block above enables NanoGPT's compatibility shim so LibreChat can render thoughts without additional changes. If you would rather not send the compatibility flag, you can instead point LibreChat at `https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1legacy/` which keeps the legacy response shape by default.

5. Set your API key in your environment variables:
   ```bash  theme={null}
   export NANO_GPT_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

That's it! Restart LibreChat, and you'll have access to all NanoGPT models through the interface.
