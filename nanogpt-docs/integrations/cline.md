# Using Cline with NanoGPT

A quick guide to setting up Cline with NanoGPT's API.

## Setup Instructions

1. Get your API key from [nano-gpt.com/api](https://nano-gpt.com/api)
2. In Cline settings, add a new Custom Model with these details:
   * API Provider: OpenAI Compatible
   * Base URL: [https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1/](https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1/)
   * API Key: Your key from step 1
   * Model ID: gpt-4o

> **Tip:** If Cline is not showing a model's `thinking` output, switch the Base URL to `https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1legacy/`. Cline still expects the legacy streaming shape for parallel thinking/output channels, and this endpoint keeps that compatibility without affecting model availability.

That's it! You can now use Cline with every model you can think of. Model names are on our [pricing page](https://nano-gpt.com/pricing) - important ones are o1, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, yi-lightning, deepseek/deepseek-chat, or just any other model you fancy.
