# Personalized Models

# Personalized Models API

Curated, OpenAI‑compatible model listing scoped to each account’s preferences.

This endpoint returns only the text models you have marked as “visible” in Settings → Models, regardless of whether they are subscription or paid models.

* GET `/api/personalized/v1/models`

See also:

* Canonical models list: `GET /api/v1/models`
* Subscription‑only list: `GET /api/subscription/v1/models`
* Paid‑only list: `GET /api/paid/v1/models`

## Compatibility & Response Shape

The response mirrors OpenAI’s Models API:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [ { /* model */ }, ... ]
}
```

Each model contains at least:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "id": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324",
  "object": "model",
  "created": 1736966400,
  "owned_by": "deepseek"
}
```

Use `?detailed=true` to include additional fields like `name`, `description`, `context_length`, `capabilities.vision`, `pricing`, `icon_url`, and `cost_estimate`.

## Authentication

An API key is required.

* `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`
* or `x-api-key: <api_key>`

If the key is missing or invalid, the endpoint returns `401`.

## Personalization Rules

* The list is filtered by your account’s visible text models (configured in the NanoGPT web app under Settings → Models → “Visible Text Models”).
* This endpoint ignores the user preference “Also show paid models.” If you marked paid models as visible, they appear here even if you generally hide paid models elsewhere.
* If you have not set any preferences, the endpoint falls back to NanoGPT defaults (`visible === true` in our model registry).

## Examples

Basic list:

```bash  theme={null}
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $NANOGPT_API_KEY" \
  https://nano-gpt.com/api/personalized/v1/models
```

Detailed list with pricing/capabilities:

```bash  theme={null}
curl -H "x-api-key: $NANOGPT_API_KEY" \
  "https://nano-gpt.com/api/personalized/v1/models?detailed=true"
```

Sample detailed item:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "id": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324",
  "object": "model",
  "created": 1736966400,
  "owned_by": "deepseek",
  "name": "DeepSeek V3 (0324)",
  "description": "General-purpose chat model with strong reasoning",
  "context_length": 128000,
  "capabilities": { "vision": false },
  "pricing": {
    "prompt": 2500,
    "completion": 10000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "unit": "per_million_tokens"
  },
  "icon_url": "/icons/DeepSeek.svg",
  "cost_estimate": {
    "cheap": true
  }
}
```

## Managing Your Visible Models

The recommended way to customize your personalized list is via the NanoGPT web UI:

* Open Settings → Models → “Visible Text Models”.
* Toggle visibility and categories as needed; changes are saved to your account.

Advanced (web session only):

* GET `/api/user/model-visibility` — returns your saved preferences as `{ modelPreferences: { visibleTextModels, modelCategories } }`.
* POST `/api/user/model-visibility` — upserts preferences. Cookie‑based session auth is required (not API‑key auth).

Payload shape:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "visibleTextModels": {
    "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324": true,
    "claude-3-haiku": false
  },
  "modelCategories": {
    "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324": "General"
  }
}
```

Keys outside NanoGPT’s known model ids are ignored.

## Notes

* This route is explicitly dynamic (no shared caching across keys).
* Model ids and metadata evolve as providers update their catalogs; keep consumers resilient to new fields.
* Personalized results may include paid models even if `/api/v1/models` hides them for your account (by design).
