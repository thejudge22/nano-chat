# Pricing

For full pricing per model see our [dedicated pricing page](https://nano-gpt.com/pricing) with all models listed. We do not charge any minimum fee per query, nor do we charge any fee on deposits.

If you are (potentially) going to be a large user of our API reach out to us at [support@nano-gpt.com](mailto:support@nano-gpt.com) or our [Discord](https://discord.gg/KaQt8gPG6V) for a discount.
