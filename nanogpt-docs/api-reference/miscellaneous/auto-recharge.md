# Auto Recharge

It's possible to turn on auto-recharge so that you can be sure not to run out of funds while using our API. This will automatically top-up your account from your credit card when your balance falls beneath a minimum that you specify.

Note that you must have made a payment or make a payment first to be able to enable auto recharge.

Payment details are stored by our payment provider (Stripe) only, we do not store these on our own servers. You can request deletion of your personal information directly from Stripe by visiting their [data deletion request page](support.stripe.com/questions/i-would-like-to-delete-the-information-stripe-has-collected-from-me).

We detect low balances every 5 minutes, so make sure to leave some buffer in your minimum before a recharge happens.

Minimum auto-recharge is \$10.
