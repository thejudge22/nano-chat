# For Providers

> Information for model providers

We work together with many providers. If you think you offer models that we don't have yet, can offer models for a lower price or have some other reason we should integrate you, feel free to reach out to us either at [support@nano-gpt.com](mailto:support@nano-gpt.com) or find us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/KaQt8gPG6V).

To speed things up, mention the following in your email:

* Company name
* How to best get in touch with you. We mostly use Discord, email and Twitter in that order.
* Why should we add you?
  * Do you have low prices?
  * Any models others don't have?
  * Any volume discounts you can offer?
  * Do you run models in a special way (decentralized backend, etc)
* What rate limits do you have?
* What is your privacy policy? Do you log prompts? If so, how long do you store them?
* Do you support credit card payments? Crypto payments? Automatic payments?
* Do you have an OpenAI compatible endpoint?
* Any other information that seems relevant
