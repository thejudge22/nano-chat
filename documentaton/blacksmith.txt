# Network & IP Allowlisting
Source: https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-administration/network-allowlisting

Control plane IPs to allowlist in GitHub for Blacksmith to register runners

## Overview

Some GitHub organizations restrict access via IP allowlists. Blacksmith's control plane needs to reach GitHub to register runners and manage workflows.

This page lists the IP addresses you must allowlist so Blacksmith can communicate with GitHub. You can manage your organization's IP allowlist in GitHub under **Settings → Security → Authentication security → IP allow list**.

## Control plane outbound IPs

These IPs are used by Blacksmith's control plane to communicate with GitHub (not by your CI jobs/runners).

* `34.107.78.182`
* `63.181.86.27`
* `63.178.35.73`

## When to allowlist these IPs

You need to allowlist these IPs if:

* Your GitHub organization has **IP allowlists** or network restrictions enabled
* Your jobs are not getting picked up by Blacksmith runners

## How this differs from runner static IPs

Blacksmith also offers **static IPs for runners** as a paid feature, allowing your CI jobs to reach your own external services from a fixed IP. See the [Static IP](/blacksmith-runners/static-ip) page for details.

* **Control plane IPs** (this page): used by Blacksmith to communicate with GitHub
* **Runner static IPs** (paid): used by your CI jobs to reach your own external services


# Permissions
Source: https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-administration/permissions

How GitHub permissions map to Blacksmith access

## Overview

Blacksmith uses GitHub for authentication, and inherits your GitHub organization's structure. All members of your GitHub organization can log in using their GitHub accounts to access the Blacksmith dashboard.

## Basics

Blacksmith inherits permissions directly from your GitHub organization:

* **Organization Admins** can manage all settings, billing, and have full access to all repositories
* **Repository permissions** (Admin/Write/Read) determine what data and actions are available for each repository
* Users without repository access in GitHub cannot view that repository's data in Blacksmith

### Key Permission Controls

# Actions
Source: https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-caching/dependencies-actions

Blacksmith automatically caches your dependencies to speed up your workflows

## Overview

When you run jobs on Blacksmith, all official GitHub and popular third-party cache actions
transparently interact with our 4x faster, colocated cache, instead of GitHub's backend.

**Zero code changes are required.**

<CodeGroup>
  ```yml actions-cache@v4 icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
      # If it's running on Blacksmith, it will use our cache
      name: Cache Cargo dependencies
      uses: actions/cache@v4
  ```

  ```yml actions-cache-save@v4 icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
      # If it's running on Blacksmith, it will use our cache
      name: Save cache
      uses: actions/cache/save@v4
      with:
        path: node_modules
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
  ```

  ```yml actions-cache-restore@v4 icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
      # If it's running on Blacksmith, it will use our cache
      name: Restore cache
      uses: actions/cache/restore@v4
      with:
        path: node_modules
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
  ```

  ```yml setup-go@v5 icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
      # If it's running on Blacksmith, it will use our cache
      name: Setup go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v5
      with:
        go-version: '>=1.17.0'
  ```

  ```yml setup-node@v4 icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
      # If it's running on Blacksmith, it will use our cache
      name: Setup node
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 20
        cache: 'npm'
  ```

  ```yml setup-python@v5 icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
      # If it's running on Blacksmith, it will use our cache
      name: Setup python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
        cache: 'pip'
  ```

  ```yml setup-ruby@v1 icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
      # If it's running on Blacksmith, it will use our cache
      name: Setup ruby
      uses: actions/setup-ruby@v1
      with:
        ruby-version: '3.3'
        bundler-cache: true
  ```

  ```yml setup-java@v4 icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
      # If it's running on Blacksmith, it will use our cache
      name: Setup java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        distribution: 'temurin'
        java-version: '21'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>Currently, the Rust `sccache` and the GitHub Actions cache option in the `docker/build-push-action` are still redirected to GitHub's backend. For 40x faster Docker builds, please use our Blacksmith Docker actions. For more information, refer to the [Docker builds](/blacksmith-caching/docker-builds) page.</Warning>

## Basics

GitHub’s cache action stores artifacts in Azure Blob Storage. When your runner isn’t in the same availability zone,
downloads are often slow and unreliable.

Blacksmith fixes this by storing cache artifacts in the same datacenter as your runners. Our approach removes network
latency and almost saturates the NIC. As a result, your downloads complete around 4x faster, with no code changes required.

### Branch Protected Caches

When using our colocated cache, each cache entry will be scoped to its branch or tag to
ensure cache entries are only accessible to the appropriate workflow runs. This enhances the
security of our cache offering by creating a logical boundary between cache artifacts. These access
restrictions are consistent with [GitHub's
implementation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/dependency-caching-reference#restrictions-for-accessing-a-cache).
If you would rather share cache artifacts across branches in a repository, you can toggle this
feature `off` in the settings page of your Blacksmith dashboard.

### Opt out

If you’d rather not use our cache for any reason, just let us know by opening a [support ticket](https://app.blacksmith.sh/?support=open) and we’ll disable it for you.

## Pricing

There is no additional cost for using our cache. For all other pricing, please visit our [pricing page](https://www.blacksmith.sh/pricing).

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much free storage do I get?">
    By default, we provide 25GB of free storage per repo per week, a substantial increase from GitHub's 10GB to maximize your cache hits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I increase the allowed cache size for my organization?">
    If you'd like us to increase the allowed cache size for your organization, contact us at
    [support@blacksmith.sh](mailto:support@blacksmith.sh).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the eviction policy?">
    Like GitHub, our cache evicts the least recently used cache entries that were last accessed more than 7 days ago.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Didn't you support another actions cache?">
    Yes. Actions cache V1 has been deprecated. Please move to the newest approach.

    <Warning>
      The following content describes the legacy approach of using
      Blacksmith-specific cache actions. This approach is now deprecated in favor of
      our [new cache](/blacksmith-caching/dependencies-actions) described above. Our new cache requires no code
      changes and automatically works with GitHub's native cache actions.

      The forks will no longer be updated by Blacksmith, so we recommend migrating workflows to the
      upstream version of the action.
    </Warning>

    This cache is a drop-in replacement for GitHub's cache action. Blacksmith's cache co-locates cache artifacts in the same datacenter park as the bare metal instances running our VMs,
    and can almost saturate the NIC on our runners. GitHub's cache action stores cache artifacts in Azure Blob Storage,
    which generally performs poorly when the action runner is not co-located in the same AZ as the storage. This results in \~4x faster cache download speeds compared to GitHub's cache.

    Migrating from the `actions/cache` to the Blacksmith cache is a one line change. Simply replace the `actions/cache@v3`
    line in your workflow files with `useblacksmith/cache@v5`.

    ```yml {3} theme={"system"}
        name: Cache dependencies
    -   uses: actions/cache@v3
    +   uses: useblacksmith/cache@v5
    ```

    If you're using `actions/cache/save` and `actions/cache/restore`, you can migrate them to `useblacksmith/cache/save` and `useblacksmith/cache/restore` respectively.

    For more information, refer to GitHub's official [documentation](https://github.com/actions/cache), since the Blacksmith cache is fully compatible with GitHub's cache.

    ### Language specific cache actions

    In addition to the `useblacksmith/cache`, the Blacksmith cache also provides drop-in replacements for GitHub's official `actions/setup-*` actions.
    These replacements have the same semantics as the official setup actions, but they are backed by Blacksmith's much faster and more reliable cache.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```yml setup-go@v6 {3} theme={"system"}
              name: Setup go
      -       uses: actions/setup-go@v4
      +       uses: useblacksmith/setup-go@v6
              with:
                go-version: '>=1.17.0'

      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Please refer to the `README` of each setup action for detailed [instructions](https://github.com/orgs/useblacksmith/repositories?q=setup-) on how to configure them.
    For languages that we don't have a setup action for, you can still leverage the `useblacksmith/cache` action to cache dependencies by following these [guidelines](https://github.com/useblacksmith/cache?tab=readme-ov-file#usage).

    Some languages have popular cache actions that are not maintained by GitHub. The Blacksmith cache offers drop-in replacements for these actions too so that you can leverage our faster cache.

        +       uses: useblacksmith/golangci-lint-action@v6
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    ### Using the Blacksmith cache inside a container

    If your GitHub Actions job runs inside a container, you will need to ensure that the container is hydrated with certain Blacksmith specific
    environment variables. These environment variables allow the container to upload and download artifacts from Blacksmith's cache.

    To do this, you can add an `env` section to your container definition as shown below.

    ```yml {3-6} theme={"system"}
      container:
          image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.41.1
    +     env:
    +       BLACKSMITH_CACHE_TOKEN: ${{ env.BLACKSMITH_CACHE_TOKEN }}
    +       BLACKSMITH_CACHE_URL: ${{ env.BLACKSMITH_CACHE_URL }}
    +       GITHUB_REPO_NAME: ${{ env.GITHUB_REPO_NAME }}
    ```

    If the container image does not have `tar` installed, you will need to install it as a step inside the container. `tar` is required to extract
    the artifacts downloaded from Blacksmith's cache.

    ```yml theme={"system"}
      steps:
          - name: Install GNU tar
            run: |
              apk add --no-cache tar
    ```

    Without these steps, you will see a `401` error or an `Unauthenticated` error when restoring or saving to the Blacksmith cache.

# Sticky Disks
Source: https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-caching/dependencies-sticky-disks

Blacksmith optionally offers Sticky Disks to speed up your workflows

## Overview

[useblacksmith/stickydisk](https://github.com/useblacksmith/stickydisk) is a GitHub Action that helps persist state written to disk across jobs.
This action can serve as a superior alternative to the Actions cache, especially when the cache artifacts are extremely large. Each sticky disk is hot-loaded into the runner and mounted at the specified path. The sticky disk is formatted as an ext4 filesystem.

<Warning>
  The `useblacksmith/stickydisk` action is currently in beta. There may be bugs and behavior may change. Please report issues on the GitHub repository.
</Warning>

## Basics

### Cache Performance Comparison

| Caching Solution     | Cache Size | Average Download Speed | Time to Access |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
| GitHub Actions Cache | 6GB        | 90 MB/s                | \~1m6s         |
| Blacksmith Cache     | 6GB        | 400 MB/s               | \~15s          |
| Sticky Disks         | 6GB        | N/A                    | 3 seconds      |

### Use Cases

#### NPM Package Caching

Node.js projects can have extensive dependency trees, leading to large `node_modules` directories. Sticky disks provide persistent, high-performance storage for your NPM packages.

```yml Diff Example icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: blacksmith # [!code ++]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: useblacksmith/setup-node@v5  # [!code ++]
        with:
          node-version: '18.x'
      
      - name: Mount NPM Cache
        uses: useblacksmith/stickydisk@v1  # [!code ++]
        with:
          key: ${{ github.repository }}-npm-cache
          path: ~/.npm
      
      - name: Mount node_modules
        uses: useblacksmith/stickydisk@v1  # [!code ++]
        with:
          key: ${{ github.repository }}-node-modules
          path: ./node_modules
      
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
```

#### Bazel Build Caching

Bazel's remote cache can significantly improve build times, but uploading and downloading cached artifacts can still be a bottleneck. Using sticky disks with Blacksmith runners provides near-instant access to your Bazel caches as they are bind mounted into your runners on demand. Our [`useblacksmith/setup-bazel@v2`](https://github.com/useblacksmith/setup-bazel) action is a zero-config way to use sticky disks to store the disk, repository, and external cache.

```yml Diff Example icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: blacksmith # [!code ++]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Bazel
        uses: useblacksmith/setup-bazel@v2  # [!code ++]
        with:
          version: '6.x'
      
      - name: Build
        run: |
          bazel build //...
```

### How it works

Blacksmith stores sticky disk artifacts in a secure, highly performant Ceph cluster, running on local NVMe drives.
Our runners proxy their requests through our Storage Agents to interact with the Ceph cluster.
Each sticky disk is uniquely identified by a key.
When a GitHub Action job requests a sticky disk, the last committed snapshot will be cloned and mounted into the runner at the specified path.
Once the job completes, the sticky disk will be unmounted and committed for future invocations.
At the moment, customers can use up to 5 sticky disks in a single GitHub Action job.

### Using Sticky Disks inside a container

If your GitHub Actions job runs inside a container, you will need to ensure that the container is hydrated with certain Blacksmith specific
environment variables and is running in privileged mode. These environment variables allow the runner to coordinate with our control plane
to hotload and commit the sticky disks used in the workflow. The privileged mode is required for mounting and unmounting block devices inside
a container.

The following changes can be made to your service container config in the workflow file:

```yml Diff Example icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
   container:
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.41.1
      options: --privileged  # [!code ++:7]
      env:
        VM_ID: ${{ env.VM_ID }}
        GITHUB_REPO_NAME: ${{ env.GITHUB_REPO_NAME }}
        BLACKSMITH_STICKYDISK_TOKEN: ${{ env.BLACKSMITH_STICKYDISK_TOKEN }}
        BLACKSMITH_INSTALLATION_MODEL_ID: ${{ env.BLACKSMITH_INSTALLATION_MODEL_ID }}
        BLACKSMITH_REGION: ${{ env.BLACKSMITH_REGION }}
```

If the container image does not have `sudo` installed, you will need to install it as a step inside the container. `sudo` is required for
mounting and formatting the sticky disk with proper permissions.

```yml theme={"system"}
   steps:
      - name: Install sudo
        run: |
          apk add --no-cache sudo
```

Without these steps, you will see a `401` error, an `Unauthenticated` error, or permission-related errors when attempting to mount or use the sticky disk.

## useblacksmith/stickydisk-delete

[useblacksmith/stickydisk-delete](https://github.com/useblacksmith/stickydisk-delete) allows you to delete sticky disks programmatically. It supports two deletion methods:

### Delete by Key

Delete a specific sticky disk using its key:

```yml theme={"system"}
- name: Delete sticky disk
  uses: useblacksmith/stickydisk-delete@v1
  with:
    delete-key: my-cache-disk
```

### Delete Docker Cache

Delete Docker build cache for your repository. This should be used in conjunction with `useblacksmith/setup-docker-builder@v1`, which sets up the sticky disk for Docker build caching:

```yml theme={"system"}
- name: Delete Docker cache
  uses: useblacksmith/stickydisk-delete@v1
  with:
    delete-docker-cache: true
```

### Example: Cleanup After Build

```yml theme={"system"}
name: Build with Cleanup
on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2204
    steps:
      - name: Create sticky disk for dependencies
        uses: useblacksmith/stickydisk@v1
        with:
          key: deps-cache
          path: ~/.npm

      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install and build
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run build

  cleanup:
    runs-on: blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2204
    needs: build
    if: always()
    steps:
      - name: Delete sticky disk
        uses: useblacksmith/stickydisk-delete@v1
        with:
          delete-key: deps-cache
```

# 40x Faster Docker Builds
Source: https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-caching/docker-builds

Blacksmith optionally caches your Docker layers to speed up your workflows

## Overview

Now that you have a Blacksmith runner, you can take advantage of our NVMe-backed cache to persist your Docker layers across CI runs.
To enable Docker layer caching, you'll use two Blacksmith actions in your GitHub Actions workflow file. This allows your Docker builds to reuse cached docker layers from previous runs, and only rebuild the layers that have changed.

Our [customers have reported](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7325661286027919361/) 2x to 40x improvements in build times due to this change.

```yml Diff Example icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
   name: Set up Docker Buildx
   uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3 # [!code --]
   uses: useblacksmith/setup-docker-builder@v1 # [!code ++]

   name: Build and Push Docker Image
   uses: docker/build-push-action@v3 # [!code --]
   uses: useblacksmith/build-push-action@v2 # [!code ++]
   with:
    push: true
    tags: user/app:latest
    cache-from: type=registry,ref=user/app:latest # [!code --]
    cache-to: type=inline # [!code --]
```

Any external caching that was configured with cache-from and cache-to directives can now be removed. Once you make this switch, the first Docker run will be an uncached run. Every subsequent run will have the hydrated layer cache mounted into your runners, so you should see several build steps cached from previous runs.

<Info>When using `useblacksmith/build-push-action` without `useblacksmith/setup-docker-builder`, the runner will use the default builder configured in your environment. However, this builder will not leverage Blacksmith's Docker layer caching nor will it report Docker analytics to the Blacksmith control plane.</Info>

## Basics

### Not using the `docker/build-push-action`?

If you're not using the `docker/build-push-action` in your workflow, but are instead calling Docker commands directly or are using the `docker/bake-action`, you can still cache your Docker layers by setting up a Blacksmith builder before interacting with Docker.
This builder will be hydrated with the layer cache from previous runs and will commit the updated layer cache at the end of the job.

```yml Diff Example icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
  uses: useblacksmith/setup-docker-builder@v1 # [!code ++]
  # ... Docker commands in your workflow ... 
```

### How it works

Under the hood, your Docker layer caches are stored on [sticky disks](/blacksmith-caching/dependencies-sticky-disks).

#### How caching works in Docker builds

When you do a Docker build, each step in your Dockerfile creates a new layer in your Docker image.
Without caching, when you make a change to your Dockerfile, Docker will rebuild all the layers in the image, even if only one layer has changed.
This can be slow, especially for large Docker images.

However, with caching, Docker can reuse layers from previous builds instead of rebuilding them from scratch. Docker will only rebuild from the layer that has changed and use the cached layers for the rest of the image.

#### How Blacksmith runners cache your Docker layers

When a GitHub Action job uses the Blacksmith Docker actions, the process works as follows:

1. The `setup-docker-builder` action configures a buildx builder with access to cached layers from previous runs
2. The `build-push-action` then uses this builder to run your Docker build, leveraging the cached layers instead of rebuilding everything from scratch
3. At the end of the job, the runner commits its changes to the layer cache for future runs. This commit only runs if no other steps in the job have failed or been canceled.

The Docker layer cache is shared by all runners in a repository, in your organization.
In case of several concurrent Docker builds, it may take a few runs until all the builds have their layers committed to the cache.
This is in keeping with the Last Write Wins (LWW) policy we enforce in the face of concurrent committers.

### Multi-platform builds

#### Current approach: Using a matrix strategy

You can build multi-platform Docker images on Blacksmith by using GitHub Actions matrix strategy. This approach leverages Blacksmith's native runners for each architecture to avoid the performance penalties of emulation.

```yml Diff Example icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        platform: [amd64, arm64]
        include:
          - platform: amd64
            runner: blacksmith-8vcpu-ubuntu-2204 # [!code ++]
            docker_platform: linux/amd64
          - platform: arm64
            runner: blacksmith-8vcpu-ubuntu-2204-arm # [!code ++]
            docker_platform: linux/arm64
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.runner }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Docker Builder
        uses: useblacksmith/setup-docker-builder@v1 # [!code ++]
      
      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
      
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: useblacksmith/build-push-action@v2 # [!code ++]
        with:
          push: true
          tags: user/app:${{ matrix.platform }}
          platforms: ${{ matrix.docker_platform }}
```

This approach runs each architecture build on its native hardware - the amd64 build runs on `blacksmith-8vcpu-ubuntu-2204` and the arm64 build runs on `blacksmith-8vcpu-ubuntu-2204-arm`. Each image is pushed with its own tag that includes the architecture.

For ARM builds, this avoids needing to use QEMU to emulate ARM on an amd64 runner, which can be extremely slow.

### Merging images into a multi-arch manifest

After building separate images for each architecture, you can merge them into a single multi-arch manifest using Docker's manifest commands:

```yml Diff Example icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
jobs:
  build:
    # ... matrix strategy builds from above ...
  
  merge-manifests:
    needs: build
    runs-on: blacksmith # [!code ++]
    steps:
      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
      
      - name: Create and push multi-arch manifest
        run: |
          docker manifest create user/app:latest \
            user/app:amd64 \
            user/app:arm64
          docker manifest push user/app:latest
```

For registries that require explicit annotation of architectures:

```yml Diff Example icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
- name: Create and push annotated manifest
  run: |
    docker manifest create user/app:latest \
      user/app:amd64 \
      user/app:arm64
    docker manifest annotate user/app:latest user/app:amd64 --arch amd64
    docker manifest annotate user/app:latest user/app:arm64 --arch arm64
    docker manifest push user/app:latest
```

#### Coming soon: Native multi-platform support

In the future, the `useblacksmith/build-push-action` action will support multi-platform builds natively. You'll simply need to specify the platforms you want to build for in the `platforms` input, and Blacksmith will automatically spawn native builders for each platform, eliminating the need for the matrix strategy shown above.

```yml Diff Example icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: blacksmith-8vcpu-ubuntu-2204 # [!code ++]
    steps:
    ...
    - name: Build and push Docker image
      uses: useblacksmith/build-push-action@v2 # [!code ++]
      with:
        platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
```

When this feature is available, each image will be built on a native builder (i.e., the amd64 Docker build on a `blacksmith-8vcpu-ubuntu-2204` and the arm64 build on a `blacksmith-8vcpu-ubuntu-2204-arm` runner) and automatically merged into a single multi-arch manifest.

#### Security

Docker layer caching executes within the same runners that process your GitHub Actions workflows. This means they automatically inherit all security protections
and isolations that are detailed in our [security documentation](https://www.blacksmith.sh/security).

The BuildKit daemon in each runner (`buildkitd`) that powers Docker builds, runs exclusively on a local Unix socket and is not exposed to the public internet.

The Docker layer cache for each repository is stored in a secure Ceph cluster. Every runner gets an ephemeral authentication token that allows it to request and commit artifacts.
The runners do not have persistent credentials to the Ceph cluster or direct access to artifacts in the cluster. The Ceph cluster is configured with object-level access controls.

# Container Caching (Beta)
Source: https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-caching/docker-container-caching

Blacksmith pre-hydrates service containers to eliminate pull and extraction overhead

## Overview

A significant percentage of GitHub Actions workflows use [service containers](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/using-containerized-services/about-service-containers) to run databases, caches, and other dependencies alongside their jobs. Every time a workflow runs, these containers must be pulled from a registry and extracted before the job can begin. This adds seconds to minutes of overhead to every CI run.

With Docker container caching, Blacksmith pre-hydrates commonly used containers directly onto the runners. When your workflow starts, the containers are already present and ready to go. The pull and extraction steps become a no-op, shaving valuable time off every job in your repository.

## Impact

The "Initialize Containers" step in GitHub Actions is where service containers are pulled and started. With Docker container caching, this step goes from taking over a minute to completing in about a second.

**Before: 1m 20s to initialize containers**

<img alt="Initialize Containers step taking 1 minute 20 seconds without caching" />

**After: 1s to initialize containers**

<img alt="Initialize Containers step taking 1 second with caching" />

This improvement applies to every job in your repository that uses service containers, adding up to significant time savings across your CI pipelines.

## How it works

Docker container caching uses [sticky disks](/blacksmith-caching/dependencies-sticky-disks) to persist container images across workflow runs. When a container is first pulled and extracted, it gets stored on a sticky disk associated with your repository. On subsequent runs, the container is already present on the runner and ready to start immediately.

## Availability

Docker container caching is currently in private beta. To enable this feature for your organization, please reach out to [support@blacksmith.sh](mailto:support@blacksmith.sh).

## Monitoring usage

You can monitor the storage usage for your Docker container sticky disk in the [Sticky Disks page](https://app.blacksmith.sh/sticky-disks) in the Blacksmith dashboard. Future updates will add more detailed information about exactly which container images are being cached.

## Pricing

Docker container caching is charged at the same rate as sticky disks. For pricing details, please visit our [pricing page](https://www.blacksmith.sh/pricing).


# Docker Pulls
Source: https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-caching/docker-pulls

Blacksmith automatically caches public docker images to speed up your workflows

## Overview

Blacksmith by default enables a local [Docker registry mirrors](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/mirror/) across our fleet, which act as “pull through” caches for public Docker images.
All Docker pulls on Blacksmith runners are routed through these mirrors, and they only need to hit Docker Hub once, to hydrate the cache.
This pull hydrates that particular image into the registry mirror so that subsequent pulls, across organizations, are served through
a node-local registry backed by our colocated cache store. This means common image pulls are substantially faster.

<Note>The Docker pull through mirror only caches public images. We do not cache private images.</Note>

<img />

## Basics

### Preventing rate limit errors

The other main benefit is that CI jobs across an organization will now not be pulling as frequently from the Docker Hub and will
therefore not run into Docker Hub’s rate limits. Prior to the pull through caches, our customers would occasionally run into rate limit errors such as:

```
ERROR: toomanyrequests: Too Many Requests.
```

```
You have reached your pull rate limit. You may increase the limit by authenticating and upgrading: https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limits.
```

This became even more common occurence after [Docker Hub's new rate limits were introduced on April 1st, 2025](https://www.blacksmith.sh/blog/you-have-5-days-before-the-new-dockerhub-limits-f-ck-you-over)

In case you continue to run into rate limit errors, please contact us at [hello@blacksmith.sh](mailto:hello@blacksmith.sh). As a temporary workaround, authenticating with Docker Hub will allow your workflows to pull images with a much higher rate limit.

<Accordion title="Authenticating with Docker Hub">
  To authenticate with Docker Hub, you can use the `docker login` command with your Docker Hub username and password. Here's an example of how to authenticate with Docker Hub:

  ```yml theme={"system"}
      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}
  ```

  ### Authenticating service containers with Docker Hub credentials

  If you're using [service containers](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-containerized-services/about-service-containers) in your workflows, you can authenticate with Docker Hub using the `credentials` option.

  ```yml theme={"system"}
    jobs:
    build:
      services:
        redis:
          # Docker Hub image
          image: redis
          ports:
            - 6379:6379
          credentials:
            username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
            password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}

# CI Analytics
Source: https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-observability/dashboard

Fastest way to monitor your GitHub Actions performance and costs across your team

## Overview

Blacksmith's CI Analytics dashboard provides a single view of your
CI pipeline's **performance**, **failure rate**, and **costs**.
All users within your organization who have access to GitHub can log
in at [app.blacksmith.sh](https://app.blacksmith.sh) to explore the dashboard.

## Basics

### Jobs

The dashboard displays every job run across all your repositories.

<img alt="Jobs View" />

You can filter and analyze jobs by repository, runner size, job status, and more, enabling you to answer questions like:

* "What is the failure rate of my jobs?"
* "How long does this job typically take to complete?"
* "What is affecting the performance of my slowest job?"

<Card title="Zoom In: Finding out if a Job is Failing More Than Usual" icon="note">
  For instance, Blacksmith's dashboard helps identify if a job is failing more often than usual. By filtering jobs by repository, you can assess failure rates and compare them to previous months.

  <img alt="Jobs Zoom In" />
</Card>

<Card title="Zoom In: Finding out What is Affecting the Performance of Your Slowest Job" icon="note">
  Blacksmith's dashboard helps identify what is affecting the performance of your slowest job. By hovering over the "p99" in the job duration distribution chart, you can see a breakdown of your slowest job's steps and the time taken for each step.

  <img alt="Jobs Zoom In" />
</Card>

### Caches

The dashboard also provides insights into every cache entry across your repositories.

<img alt="Cache View" />

You can filter and analyze cache entries by repository, cache key, last hit time, and more, to answer questions like:

* "What is my total cache usage?"
* "What cache entries are currently available?"
* "How many recent cache hits have I had?"

<Card title="Zoom In: Finding the Last Cache Hit for a Specific Key" icon="note">
  Blacksmith makes it simple to track when a cache key was last hit. You can filter by repository to check the last hit time of cache entries, ensuring the cache key is functioning as expected.

  <img alt="Cache Zoom In" />
</Card>

### Costs

The dashboard also provides visibility into all Blacksmith usage and billing.

<img alt="Costs View" />

You can break down costs by repository to better understand CI expenses and ask questions such as:

* "How much more did I spend this month?"
* "Which repositories are consuming the most resources?"
* "How much am I spending on storage for caches?"

<Card title="Zoom In: Finding out which repositories are consuming the most resources" icon="note">
  With Blacksmith you can track spending across repositories to identify how your teams and services are consuming compute and storage resources.

# Run History
Source: https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-observability/history

Fastest way to search, filter, and debug past CI runs on Blacksmith runners

<img alt="Job view interface" />

## Overview

The Run History page is your central hub for searching, filtering, and debugging all CI workflows and jobs
across Blacksmith runners.

Whenever you’re tracking down who introduced a bug or checking whether a recent change caused a
failure, the Run History page helps you find answers quickly.

## Basics

Go to the **Workflow/Jobs** page and click on a job run to see its details. From there, you can
view logs, compare runs, review metrics, and more.

### Logs

<img alt="Logs view interface" />

You can search and filter logs using the dedicated log search bar. This is a much snappier
experience than GitHub’s log search.

#### Global log search

<img alt="Global log search interface" />

If you want to see when a particular log line (e.g., an error) first appeared, you can select
that log line and search for it globally across your entire CI pipeline.

To learn more about how this works, check out our [logs page](/blacksmith-observability/logs).

### Metrics

<img alt="Metrics view interface" />

You can view metrics from the machine running the job.

# Logs
Source: https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-observability/logs

Fastest way to search and filter logs across all CI jobs running on Blacksmith runners

## Overview

Whether you're triaging a broken build in a pull request or digging into a flaky test that only happens on main, logs are now a much better experience in GitHub Actions. You'll be able to zoom in locally or investigate patterns globally across all your CI runs.

<iframe />

## Basics

### Query Syntax Guide

Let's break down the query syntax:

```plaintext theme={"system"}
branch:main level:error,warn failed -"econn refused"
```

### Property Filters

You can search and filter your logs using the following criteria:

| **Filter**      | **Description**                                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `run_id:*`      | Filter by workflow run instances (each run may contain multiple jobs) |
| `run_attempt:*` | Filter by the attempt number of a given workflow run                  |
| `workflow:*`    | Filter by GitHub workflow name                                        |
| `pr:*`          | Filter by pull request number                                         |
| `branch:*`      | Filter by Git branch associated with the run                          |
| `repo:*`        | Filter by repository name                                             |
| `job_id:*`      | Filter by specific job IDs                                            |
| `job_name:*`    | Filter by job names                                                   |
| `step_id:*`     | Filter by specific step IDs                                           |
| `step_name:*`   | Filter by workflow step names                                         |
| `user:*`        | Filter by the user who triggered the workflow                         |
| `level:*`       | Filter by severity (`info`, `warn`, `debug`, `error`)                 |

In this example, we are filtering for logs from the `main` branch and only showing logs with severity `error` or `warn`:

```plaintext theme={"system"}
branch:main level:error,warn
```

#### Substring Search

You can search for text across your logs using the log search bar. For multi-word phrases, use quotes. In this example, we are searching for logs containing the phrase "failed":

```plaintext theme={"system"}
failed
```

#### Exclude Matches

You can exclude matches by prefixing a search term with `-`. In this example, we are excluding logs containing the phrase "econn refused":

```plaintext theme={"system"}
-"econn refused"
```

#### Escaping Special Characters

* **Quotes**: Escape with backslash: `\"`
* **Backslashes**: Escape with backslash: `\\`
* **Keywords**: Wrap AND/OR in quotes to search literally: `"AND"` `"OR"`

# Metrics
Source: https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-observability/metrics

Easiest way to monitor machine metrics on Blacksmith runners

## Overview

Blacksmith automatically collects machine metrics for all jobs that are run on Blacksmith runners.
**No configuration required**.
Blacksmith's Metrics provides a way to check whether your jobs are running into resource constraints or if your job runners are overprovisioned.

All users within your organization who have access to GitHub can log in at [app.blacksmith.sh](https://app.blacksmith.sh) to view metrics on their jobs.

## Basics

### Job Metrics

The Metrics tab in the Job Details view in the dashboard displays machine metrics for a job run.

<img alt="Metrics" />

### Job Step Timeline

You can jump to the logs for a specific step of a job run. Just click on a step in the timeline displayed above the charts to go to the [Logs tab](/blacksmith-observability/logs) with the relevant log section automatically expanded.

### Common Use Cases

#### Debug Slow Jobs

1. Check for high CPU usage or memory usage for a job. If the runner is undersized for the job's workload, the job may take longer than expected.
2. Check for lower network I/O than expected for a job. If there is network degradation between Blacksmith's runners and the servers your job communicates with, dependency downloads and Docker image pushes/pulls may be slower.

#### Rightsize Runners

If there is low CPU usage and/or memory usage for a job, you may be able reduce costs without impacting job runtime significantly by running your job on a smaller runner.


# SSH Access
Source: https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-observability/ssh-access

Fastest way to debug running jobs and inspect VM state

## Overview

SSH into running jobs to debug issues, inspect state, or troubleshoot your workflows in real-time. When enabled by your organization admin, access is granted to job triggerers using their GitHub SSH keys.

<Note>
  SSH access is **opt-in** and must be enabled by a GitHub organization admin from the [Settings > Features page](https://app.blacksmith.sh/settings?tab=features) before it can be used.
</Note>

## Basics

When SSH access is enabled for your organization and a job starts on a Blacksmith runner, the runner authorizes connections using the SSH keys you've added to your GitHub account.

<Warning>
  **Access requirements:**

  * SSH access must be enabled by an organization admin
  * Only the GitHub user who triggered the job can SSH into the runner
  * You must be a member of the GitHub organization
  * SSH keys must be configured in your GitHub account
</Warning>

Each runner exposes a unique SSH port that's displayed in your workflow logs at the start of every job.

### Connecting to a runner

At the beginning of each job, you'll see connection information in the `Setup runner` step:

```bash theme={"system"}
ssh -p 12345 runner@...
```

Simply copy and run the command in your terminal to connect using your GitHub SSH key.

#### Simplify connections with SSH config

Add this to your `~/.ssh/config` file to streamline connections:

```
Host *.vm.blacksmith.sh
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
```

With this configuration, you can connect using just:

```bash theme={"system"}
ssh -p 12345 runner@...
```

<Note>
  The `StrictHostKeyChecking no` and `UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null` settings
  skip host key verification since runner VMs are ephemeral and get new host
  keys each time. This also avoids cluttering your known\_hosts file with
  temporary VM fingerprints.
</Note>

### Common use cases

#### Debug failing tests

Connect to inspect test artifacts, environment variables, or running processes when tests fail unexpectedly.

#### Verify build outputs

Check generated files, build artifacts, or compilation outputs directly on the runner.

#### Inspect environment state

Examine installed dependencies, system configurations, or runtime environments during workflow execution.

#### Troubleshoot network issues

Test connectivity, DNS resolution, or API access from within the runner environment.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I enable SSH access for my organization?">
    SSH access is opt-in and must be enabled by a GitHub organization admin:

    1. Navigate to the [Settings > Features page](https://app.blacksmith.sh/settings?tab=features)
    2. Toggle "SSH Access" to enable it for your organization
    3. Organization members can now SSH into jobs they trigger

    Only GitHub organization admins can toggle this setting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I keep a job running for debugging?">
    Add a sleep step that runs on failure to give yourself time to connect and debug:

    ```yaml theme={"system"}
    - name: Keep job alive on failure for debugging
      if: failure()
      run: |
        echo "Job failed. Keeping VM alive for 30 minutes for debugging..."
        echo "SSH connection info is available in the Setup runner step above"
        sleep 1800
    ```

    <Note>
      We don't recommend using the `action-tmate` step as it's unnecessary with
      Blacksmith's built-in SSH support, and adds complexity to your workflow.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why am I getting 'Could not resolve hostname'?">
    This error means the job has already finished. SSH access is only available while the job is actively running. Add a sleep step (see above) to keep the job alive longer.

# Test Analytics (Beta)
Source: https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-observability/test-analytics

Easiest way to monitor your test suite health across your team

## Overview

Blacksmith automatically detects the tests that are running in your repository
for all jobs that are run on Blacksmith runners.
**No configuration required**.
Blacksmith's Test Analytics provides a way to quickly identify failing tests and
how to fix them with inline logs.

All users within your organization who have access to GitHub can log
in at [app.blacksmith.sh](https://app.blacksmith.sh) to view tests on their jobs.

## Basics

### Job Tests

The Tests tab in the Job Details view in the dashboard lists out all parsed
tests associated with a job run.

<img alt="Test Analytics" />

Jobs are searchable by name and filterable by status:

<iframe />

#### JUnit Test Parsing

If your test suite outputs a JUnit XML file, Blacksmith will automatically parse
it and extract structured test information directly in the Blacksmith dashboard.

#### Auto-Parsed Tests

Blacksmith will automatically parse your job logs for output that looks like
test runs and convert them into a structured format to easily search through
your tests and identify test failures.

Auto-parsing tests is still a best-effort basis. *It is still recommended to
output a stuctured JUnit XML summary of your test run for best results.*
JUnit XML files will take precedence over auto-parsed test results from log
output.

### GitHub Comment

By default, when CI jobs are failing on your PR, Blacksmith will post a GitHub
comment with specific test failures if any are detected.

<img alt="GH Comment Failing Test" />

If no test failures are detected, Blacksmith will link to failing jobs and show
a snippet of the last few lines of the failing step.

<img alt="GH Comment Failing Job" />

You can manage the GitHub comment settings on your settings page.

## Pricing

There is no additional cost for using this feature. For all other pricing,
please visit our [pricing page](https://www.blacksmith.sh/pricing).

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which test suites are support for Auto-Parsed Tests?">
    We're working on improving the auto-test parsing to support more languages
    and output formats.

    We aim to support most popular test libraries. Currently supported libraries are:

    * Jest
    * Pytest
    * Rspec
    * Vitest
    * Mocha
    * Go `testing`
    * Playwright

    If your library isn't listed, you can always output a strucutred JUnit XML
    summary of your tests, which is supported by most testing libraries.
    Blacksmith will automatically parse them out and use it as the canonical
    source of truth for your tests.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I upload my JUnit XML artifact to Blacksmith">
    All JUnit XML files written to disk during the lifetime of a job will be
    automatically detected and parsed by Blacksmith. No configuration required.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What do I do if my tests are being incorrectly parsed?">
    If you see incorrect test entries or incorrect logs associated with your
    tests, help our team fix them by reporting errors directly inline.

    Go to an incorrectly parsed tests and in the context menu, select "Report
    Incorrect Test Parsing" and fill out the modal with any additional
    information.

    <img alt="Report Parsing Error Menu" />

    <img alt="Report Parsing Error Modal" />
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why can't I see any parsed tests?">
    Please check the following if you're not seeing any parsed tests when you expect to:

    * Ensure that the job ran the tests and it didn't error before tests got to
      run.

    * If you're not emitting a JUnit XML report for your test suite, ensure that
      the test results are logged to the job output with the test suite and test
      case name.

    * If you're still not seeing test results, consider configuring your test
      suite provider to emit a strucutred JUnit XML for better results. The JUnit
      XML file can be written anywhere you'd like and the Blacksmith runners will
      automatically detect it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I control being notified about the GitHub comments?">
    In the feature settings on the [Blacksmith
    Dashboard](https://app.blacksmith.sh) you can control whether the GitHub
    comments that Blacksmith posts are posted on behalf of the user creating the
    PR.

    GitHub comments posted on behlaf of the PR author (e.g. email notifications,
    Linear, etc) will not trigger a notification on the PR.

    Note: The PR author needs to have signed into the Blacksmith dashboard for
    the Blacksmith bot to post on behalf of a user. See [GitHub's
    docs](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/authenticating-with-a-github-app-on-behalf-of-a-user)

# Instance Types
Source: https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-runners/overview

Blacksmith runners are 2x faster and costs 75% less than GitHub-hosted runners

```yml Diff Example icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # [!code --]
    runs-on: blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2404 # [!code ++]
```

## Overview

* **We're substantially faster:** We orchestrate jobs over our fleet of modern gaming CPUs which have significantly higher single-thread performance compared to their server counterparts. Blacksmith is twice as fast as GitHub's decade-old server hardware for most CI jobs. Learn more about our runners [here](/blacksmith-runners/overview#runner-tags).

* **We're able to provision runners instantly:** Blacksmith runs jobs in ephemeral Firecracker microVMs which boot up in less than 3 seconds, regardless of runner size and number of concurrent jobs. We maintain our own homogenous pool of compute, so your CI jobs don't compete with other on-demand workloads like they would on a hyperscaler like AWS.

* **We're less than half the cost:** Our runners are exactly half the cost of GitHub's per minute. Since Blacksmith runners are also faster, you will consume fewer minutes than on GitHub.
  Discover your potential savings with Blacksmith [here](https://www.blacksmith.sh/pricing).

* **We're a drop-in replacement:** Blacksmith runners boot off of the same image(s) as GitHub's runners and have the exact same environment. Transitioning to Blacksmith is as simple as changing a single line in your workflow file.

* **We co-locate your cache right next to your runners:** All official GitHub and popular third-party cache actions transparently interact with our co-located cache which quadruples cache throughput to 400MB/s,
  significantly outperforming GitHub's cache backend. Read more about it [here](/blacksmith-caching/dependencies-actions).

* **We offer unlimited concurrency:** Blacksmith runners are not subject to the same concurrency limits as GitHub-hosted runners. You can run as many jobs as you need, without the risk of being queued.

## Basics

To switch to a Blacksmith runner, just replace the current tag with the appropriate Blacksmith runner tag.

### Free Upgrades

Blacksmith maintains a fleet of bare metal gaming CPUs that these runners are orchestrated over. When our fleet has substantial spare capacity, our system automatically bumps a runner to the next tier, at no additional cost to the user. Example: A `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2204` runner may get bumped to `blacksmith-8vcpu-ubuntu-2204` for no additional cost.

### Pre-installed Packages

#### Ubuntu x64

Blacksmith runners are pre-installed with the same dependencies supported by [GitHub's official runner image](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/ubuntu/Ubuntu2204-Readme.md).

#### Ubuntu ARM

Blacksmith ARM runners are pre-installed with the same dependencies supported by [GitHub's official ARM runner image](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).

#### Windows x64 (Public Beta)

Blacksmith Windows runners are based on [GitHub's official Windows runner image](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/windows/Windows2025-Readme.md) but with some exclusions optimized for VM performance:

**Not included:**

* Visual Studio (full IDE) - VS Build Tools 2022 is available instead

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is there a free tier?">
    Blacksmith provides `3000 x64 2vCPU minutes` for free per month per organization. These minutes can be used on runners with higher vCPU counts, but the minutes will be consumed at a higher rate proportional to the vCPU count.
    For instance, a job taking 10 minutes on a 4vCPU runner would consume the equivalent of 20 2vCPU minutes and a job taking 10 minutes on an 8vCPU runner would consume the equivalent of 40 2vCPU minutes.

    Note that ARM runners may also utilize the free minutes. For billing purposes, `1 ARM vCPU minute = 0.625 x64 2vCPU minutes`.
    The same conversion rate applies proportionally to runners with higher vCPU counts. For example, a job running for 10 minutes on an ARM 4vCPU runner would consume `12.5 x64 2vCPU minutes`.

    Windows runners may also utilize the free minutes. For billing purposes, `1 Windows vCPU minute = 2 x64 vCPU minutes`.
    The same conversion rate applies proportionally to runners with higher vCPU counts. For example, a job running for 10 minutes on a Windows 4vCPU runner would consume `80 x64 2vCPU minutes`.
    Note that Blacksmith Windows runners are still half the cost of equivalent GitHub-hosted Windows runners.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the concurrency limits?">
    Blacksmith does not impose any concurrency limits i.e., limits on how many vCPUs or jobs that can be run simultaneously.
    Our mission is to offer a truly serverless experience for your CI.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to worry about queuing?">
    No. A common complaint from customers migrating from GitHub-hosted runners or self-hosted setups are the long wait times for a job to be picked up by larger runners (8vCPU+), especially during peak hours.
    All Blacksmith runner configurations (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 vCPU) are instantly available on demand.

    We maintain our own homogenous pool of compute, so your CI jobs don't compete with other on-demand workloads like they would on hyperscalers like AWS, GCP or Azure.
    This helps our customers aggressively shard their test suites and deploy pipelines without worrying about queued jobs due to a lack of available runners.

# Static IP
Source: https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-runners/static-ip

Use Blacksmith runners with a dedicated static IP

## Overview

CI pipelines often interact with external services like databases and APIs that block requests from unknown IPs.
We offer static IPs for Blacksmith runners. Whitelisting these IPs in your external services would allow Blacksmith runners to access them securely.

## Basics

On purchasing a static IP, all of the organization's runners will use a dedicated, encrypted [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) tunnel to route network packets through a NAT gateway with a static IP.
The dedicated tunnel per NAT gateway ensures complete isolation of network traffic for that organization from other Blacksmith subnets.

### Setup

To enable static IPs for your organization, please contact us through [our support portal](https://app.blacksmith.sh/?support=open).

## Pricing

For pricing, please visit our [pricing page](https://www.blacksmith.sh/pricing).


# Quickstart

Try the fastest way to run your GitHub Actions in under 5 minutes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up our GitHub integration">
    Start by going to [app.blacksmith.sh](https://app.blacksmith.sh) and follow the steps to grant Blacksmith the necessary permissions to execute your GitHub Action jobs on Blacksmith's infrastructure.

    <Note> Blacksmith is limited to GitHub organizations and not available for personal repositories.</Note>

    <Note>
      If your GitHub organization uses **IP allowlists** or network restrictions, you may need to allowlist
      Blacksmith's control plane IPs so we can communicate with GitHub.
      See [Network & IP Allowlisting](/blacksmith-administration/network-allowlisting) for details.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use our Migration Wizard to update your GitHub Actions workflow files">
    <div>
      <video />
    </div>

    <Accordion title="Don't see your organization in the Blacksmith dashboard?">
      This could be because of a few reasons:

      1. The GitHub organization has SSO enabled, but the current session is not authenticated. Make sure you authenticate with the SSO provider within GitHub and then refresh the Blacksmith dashboard.

      2. The GitHub organization does not have the Blacksmith app installed. Verify that the Blacksmith app is correctly installed in the organization.

      3. The GitHub user is not a member of the organization. Double-check that the user is a member of the organization.

      If you are still having issues, reach out to us at [support@blacksmith.sh](mailto:support@blacksmith.sh).
    </Accordion>

    If you've chosen to ignore the Migration Wizard (don't, really), continue reading this step. To switch to a Blacksmith runner, just manually replace the current tag with the appropriate [Blacksmith runner tag](/blacksmith-runners/overview#runner-tags).

    ```yml Diff Example icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest # [!code --]
        runs-on: blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2404 # [!code ++]
    ```

    <Note>Workflow files may contain multiple jobs. Ensure you update all `runs-on` fields to utilize Blacksmith runners.</Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Cache dependencies and build outputs to run even faster (recommended)">
    When you run jobs on Blacksmith, all official GitHub and popular third-party cache actions transparently interact
    with our 4x faster, colocated cache, instead of GitHub's backend. Plus, enjoy **25GB** of free storage per repository each week, 2.5x what GitHub offers.

    ```yml Diff Example icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
    # If it's running on Blacksmith, it will use our cache
    name: Cache Cargo dependencies
    uses: actions/cache@v4
    ```

    To learn more about how we achieve this, checkout our [dependencies cache page](/blacksmith-caching/dependencies-actions).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Cache Docker layers to make your Docker builds even faster (recommended)">
    Blacksmith lets your Docker builds in GitHub Actions reuse cached layers, rebuilding only what's changed and speeding up your builds by up to 40x.

    ```yml Diff Example icon="code" lines theme={"system"}
    name: Set up Docker Buildx
    uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3 # [!code --]
    uses: useblacksmith/setup-docker-builder@v1 # [!code ++]

    name: Build and Push Docker Image
